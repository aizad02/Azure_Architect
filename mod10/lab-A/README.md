# Lab: Azure Monitor
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

You have been asked to create a proof of concept of monitoring virtual machine performance. Specifically, you want to:

- Configure a virtual machine such that telemetry and logs can be collected.
- Show what telemetry and logs can be collected.
- Show how the data can be used and queried. 

> For all the resources in this lab, we are using the **southeastasia** region. Verify with your instructor this is the region to use for class. 

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following exercise:

- Exercise 1: Collect data from an Azure virtual machine with Azure Monitor

### Exercise 1: Collect data from an Azure virtual machine with Azure Monitor

### Exercise timing: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks: 

- Task 1: Deploy an Azure virtual machine 
- Task 2: Create a Log Analytics workspace
- Task 3: Enable the Log Analytics virtual machine extension
- Task 4: Collect virtual machine event and performance data
- Task 5: View and query collected data 

#### Task 1: Deploy an Azure virtual machine

1. Sign-in to the Azure portal **`https://portal.azure.com/`**.

    >**Note**: Sign in to the Azure portal using an account that has the Owner or Contributor role in the Azure subscription you are using for this lab.

1. Open the Cloud Shell by clicking the first icon in the top right of the Azure Portal. If prompted, select **PowerShell** and **Create storage**.

1. Ensure **PowerShell** is selected in the drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of the Cloud Shell pane.

1. In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a resource group that will be used in this lab:
  
    ```powershell
    New-AzResourceGroup -Name AZ500LAB131415 -Location 'southeastasia'
    ```

    >**Note**: This resource group will be used for labs A, B, and C in mod10

1. In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a new Azure virtual machine. 

    ```powershell
    New-AzVm -ResourceGroupName "AZ500LAB131415" -Name "myVM" -Location 'southeastasia' -VirtualNetworkName "myVnet" -SubnetName "mySubnet" -SecurityGroupName   "myNetworkSecurityGroup" -PublicIpAddressName "myPublicIpAddress" -OpenPorts 80,3389
    ```

1.  When prompted for credentials:

    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |User name|**localadmin**|
    |Password|**Pa55w.rd1234**|

    >**Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete. 

1. In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to confirm that the virtual machine named **myVM** was created and its **ProvisioningState** is **Succeeded**.

    ```powershell
    Get-AzVM -Name 'myVM' -ResourceGroupName 'AZ500LAB131415' | Format-Table
    ```

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane. 

#### Task 2: Create a Log Analytics workspace

In this task, you will create a Log Analytics workspace. 

1. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box at the top of the Azure portal page, type **Log Analytics workspaces** and press the **Enter** key.

1. On the **Log Analytics workspaces** blade, clickÂ **+ Add**.

1. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create Log Analytics workspace** blade, specify the following settings (leave others with their default values):

    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Subscription|the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab|
    |Resource group|**AZ500LAB131415**|
    |Name|any valid, globally unique name|
    |Region|**Southeast Asia**|

1. Click **Next: Pricing tier >**, on the **Pricing tier** tab of the **Create Log Analytics workspace** blade, accept the default **Pay-as-you-go (Per GB 2018)** pricing tier, and click **Review + create**.

1. On the **Review + create** tab of the **Create Log Analytics workspace** blade, click **Create**.

#### Task 3: Enable the Log Analytics virtual machine extension

In this task, you will enable the Log Analytics virtual machine extension. This extension installs the Log Analytics agent on Windows and Linux virtual machines. This agent collects data from the virtual machine and transfers it to the Log Analytics workspace that you designate. Once the agent is installed it will be automatically upgraded ensuring you always have the latest features and fixes. 

1. In the Azure portal, navigate back to the **Log Analytics workspaces** blade, and, in the list of workspaces, click the entry representing the workspace you created in the previous task.

1. On the Log Analytics workspace blade, in the **Workspace Data Sources** section, click the **Virtual machines** entry.

    >**Note**: For the agent to be successfully installed, the virtual machine must be running.

1. In the list of virtual machines, locate the entry representing the Azure VM **myVM** you deployed in the first task of this exercise and note that it is listed as **Not connected**.

1. Click the **myVM** entry and then, on the **myVM** blade, click **Connect**. 

1. Wait for the virtual machine to connect to the Log Analytics workspace.

    >**Note**: This may take a few minutes. The **Status** displayed on the **myVM** blade, will change from **Connecting** to **This workspace**. 

#### Task 4: Collect virtual machine event and performance data

In this task, you will configure collection of the Windows System log and several common performance counters. You will also review other sources that are available.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate back to the Log Analytics workspace you created earlier in this exercise.

1. On the Log Analytics workspace blade, in the **Settings** section, click **Advanced settings**.

1. On the **Advanced Settings** blade, click **Data** and review the available options including Windows Event Logs, Windows Performance Counters, Linux Performance Counters, IIS Logs, and Syslog. 

1. Ensure that **Windows Event Logs** is selected, in the **Collect events from the following event logs** text box, type **System** and then click **+**.

    >**Note**: This is how you add event logs to the workspace. Other choices include, for example, **Hardware events** or **Key Management Service**.  

1. Deselect the **INFORMATION** checkbox, leaving the **ERROR** and **WARNING** check boxes selected.

1. Click **Windows Performance Counters**.

    >**Note**: There is a suggested list of performance counters. You can customize this list. 

1. Click **Add the selected performance counters**. 

    >**Note**: The counters are added and configured with 10 second collection sample interval.
  
1. On the **Advanced Settings** blade, click **Save** at the top of page and then, to acknowledge the confirmation, click **OK**.

#### Task 5: View and query collected data

In this task, you will run a log search on your data collection. 

1. In the Azure portal, navigate back to the Log Analytics workspace you created earlier in this exercise.

1. On the Log Analytics workspace blade, in the **General** section, click **Logs**.

1. On the Logs blade, click **Get started**.  

1. On the **Example queries** pane, click **Virtual machine**
    
    >**Note**: If you dont see **Virtual machine**, click Resource Type filter and select **Virtual machines**

1. Review the list of predefined queries, identify the one you want to test, and click the corresponding **Run** button.

    >**Note**: You can start with the query **Virtual machine available memory**. If you don't get any results check the scope is set to virtual machine

1. The query will automatically open in a new query tab. 

    >**Note**: Log Analytics uses the Kusto query language. You can customize the existing queries or create your own. 

    >**Note**: The results of the query you selected are automatically displayed below the query pane. To re-run the query, click **Run**.

    >**Note**: Since this virtual machine was just created, there may not be any data yet. 

    >**Note**: You have the option of displaying data in different formats. You also have the option of creating an alert rule based on the results of the query.

> Results: You used a Log Analytics workspace to configure data sources and query logs. 

**Clean up resources**

>**Note**: Do not remove the resources from this lab as they are needed for the Azure Security Center lab( lab B ) and the Azure Sentinel lab ( lab C)

>**Note**: Please continue to lab-b

# Lab: Implementing an Azure App Service Web App with a Staging Slot
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

Adatum Corporation has a number of web apps that are updated on relatively frequent basis. While Adatum has not yet fully embraced DevOps principles, it relies on Git as its version control and is exploring the options to streamline the app updates. As Adatum is transitioning some of its workloads to Azure, the Adatum Enterprise Architecture team decided to evaluate the use of Azure App Service and its deployment slots to accomplish this objective. 

Deployment slots are live apps with their own host names. App content and configurations elements can be swapped between two deployment slots, including the production slot. Deploying apps to a non-production slot has the following benefits:

- It is possible to validate app changes in a staging deployment slot before swapping it with the production slot.

- Deploying an app to a slot first and swapping it into production makes sure that all instances of the slot are warmed up before being swapped into production. This eliminates downtime when during app deployment. The traffic redirection is seamless, and no requests are dropped because of swap operations. This workflow can be automated by configuring auto swap when pre-swap validation is not needed.

- After a swap, the slot with previously staged app has the previous production app. If the changes swapped into the production slot need to be reversed, this simply involves another swap immediately to return to the last known good state.

Deployment slots facilitate two common deployment patterns: blue/green and A/B testing. Blue-green deployment involves deploying an update into a production environment that is separate from the live application. After the deployment is validated, traffic routing is switched to the updated version. A/B testing involves gradually routing some of the traffic to a staging site in order to test a new version of an app.

The Adatum Architecture team wants to use Azure App Service web apps with deployment slots in order to test these two deployment patterns:

-  Blue/Green deployments 

-  A/B testing 


## Objectives

## Instructions

### Exercise 1: Implement an Azure App Service web app

1. Deploy an Azure App Service web app

1. Create an App Service web app deployment slot

#### Task 1: Deploy an Azure App Service web app

1. From your lab computer, start a web browser, navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and sign in by providing credentials of a user account with the Owner role in the subscription you will be using in this lab.

1. In the Azure portal, open **Cloud Shell** pane by selecting on the toolbar icon directly to the right of the search textbox.

1. If prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **Bash**. 

    >**Note**: If this is the first time you are starting **Cloud Shell** and you are presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, select the subscription you are using in this lab, and select **Create storage**. 

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a new directory named **az30314a1** and set it as your current directory:

   ```sh
   mkdir az30314a1
   cd ~/az30314a1/
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to clone a sample app repository to the **az30314a1** directory:

   ```sh
   REPO=https://github.com/Azure-Samples/html-docs-hello-world.git
   git clone $REPO
   cd html-docs-hello-world
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to configure a deployment user:

   ```sh
   USERNAME=az30314user$RANDOM
   PASSWORD=az30314pass$RANDOM
   az webapp deployment user set --user-name $USERNAME --password $PASSWORD 
   echo $USERNAME
   echo $PASSWORD
   ```
1. Verify that the deployment user was created successfully. If you receive an error message indicating a conflict, repeat the previous step.

    >**Note**: Make sure to record the value of the username and the corresponding password.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create the resource group which will host the App Service web app (replace the `<location>` placeholder with the name of the Azure region that is available in your subscription and which is closest to the location of your lab computer):

   ```sh
   LOCATION='<location>'
   RGNAME='az30314a-labRG'
   az group create --location $LOCATION --resource-group $RGNAME
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a new App Service plan:

   ```sh
   SPNAME=az30314asp$LOCATION$RANDOM
   az appservice plan create --name $SPNAME --resource-group $RGNAME --location $LOCATION --sku S1
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a new, Git-enabled App Service web app:

   ```sh
   WEBAPPNAME=az30314$RANDOM$RANDOM
   az webapp create --name $WEBAPPNAME --resource-group $RGNAME --plan $SPNAME --deployment-local-git
   ```

    >**Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete. 

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to retrieve the publishing URL of the newly created App Service web app:

   ```sh
   URL=$(az webapp deployment list-publishing-credentials --name $WEBAPPNAME --resource-group $RGNAME --query scmUri --output tsv)
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to set the git remote alias representing the Git-enabled Azure App Service web app:

   ```sh
   git remote add azure $URL
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to push to the Azure remote with git push azure master:

   ```sh
   git push azure master
   ```

    >**Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete. 

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to identify the FQDN of the newly deployed App Service web app. 

   ```sh
   az webapp show --name $WEBAPPNAME --resource-group $RGNAME --query defaultHostName --output tsv
   ```

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane.


#### Task 2: Create an App Service web app deployment slot

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **App Services** and, on the **App Services** blade, select the newly created App Service web app.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the blade displaying the newly deployed App Service web app, select the **URL** link, and verify that it displays the **Azure App Service - Sample Static HTML Site**. Leave the browser tab open.

1. On the App Service web app blade, in the **Deployment** section, select **Deployment slots** and then select **+ Add Slot**.

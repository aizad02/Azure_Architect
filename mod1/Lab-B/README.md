# Lab - Implement Traffic Management
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

You were tasked with testing managing network traffic targeting Azure virtual machines in the hub and spoke network topology, which Contoso considers implementing in its Azure environment (instead of creating the mesh topology, which you tested in the previous lab). This testing needs to include implementing connectivity between spokes by relying on user defined routes that force traffic to flow via the hub, as well as traffic distribution across virtual machines by using layer 4 and layer 7 load balancers. For this purpose, you intend to use Azure Load Balancer (layer 4) and Azure Application Gateway (layer 7).

>**Note**: This lab, by default, requires total of 8 vCPUs available in the Standard_Dsv3 series in the region you choose for deployment, since it involves deployment of four Azure VMs of Standard_D2s_v3 SKU. If you are using trial accounts, with the limit of 4 vCPUs, you can use a VM size that requires only one vCPU (such as Standard_B1s).

## Objectives

In this lab, you will:

+ Task 1: Provision the lab environment
+ Task 2: Configure the hub and spoke network topology
+ Task 3: Test transitivity of virtual network peering
+ Task 4: Configure routing in the hub and spoke topology
+ Task 5: Implement Azure Load Balancer
+ Task 6: Implement Azure Application Gateway

## Estimated timing: 60 minutes

## Instructions

### Exercise 1

#### Task 1: Provision the lab environment

In this task, you will deploy four virtual machines into the same Azure region. The first two will reside in a hub virtual network, while each of the remaining to will reside in a separate spoke virtual network.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the Azure portal, open the **Azure Cloud Shell** by clicking on the icon in the top right of the Azure Portal.

1. If prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **PowerShell**. 

    >**Note**: If this is the first time you are starting **Cloud Shell** and you are presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, select the subscription you are using in this lab, and click **Create storage**. 

1. In the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, click the **Upload/Download files** icon, in the drop-down menu, click **Upload** and upload the files **\\Allfiles\\Labs\\06\\az104-06-vms-template.json**, **\\Allfiles\\Labs\\06\\az104-06-vm-template.json**, and **\\Allfiles\\Labs\\06\\az104-06-vm-parameters.json** into the Cloud Shell home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create the first resource group that will be hosting the first virtual network and the pair of virtual machines:

   ```pwsh
   $location = 'southeastasia'

   $rgName = 'az104-06-rg1'

   New-AzResourceGroup -Name $rgName -Location $location
   ```
1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create the first virtual network and deploy a pair of virtual machines into it by using the template and parameter files you uploaded:

   ```pwsh
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
      -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
      -TemplateFile $HOME/az104-06-vms-template.json `
      -TemplateParameterFile $HOME/az104-06-vm-parameters.json `
      -AsJob
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create the second resource group that will be hosting the second virtual network and the third virtual machine

   ```pwsh
   $rgName = 'az104-06-rg2'

   New-AzResourceGroup -Name $rgName -Location $location
   ```
1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create the second virtual network and deploy a virtual machine into it by using the template and parameter files you uploaded:

   ```pwsh
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
      -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
      -TemplateFile $HOME/az104-06-vm-template.json `
      -TemplateParameterFile $HOME/az104-06-vm-parameters.json `
      -nameSuffix 2 `
      -AsJob
   ```
1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create the third resource group that will be hosting the third virtual network and the fourth virtual machine:

   ```pwsh
   $rgName = 'az104-06-rg3'

   New-AzResourceGroup -Name $rgName -Location $location
   ```
1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create the third virtual network and deploy a virtual machine into it by using the template and parameter files you uploaded:

   ```pwsh
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
      -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
      -TemplateFile $HOME/az104-06-vm-template.json `
      -TemplateParameterFile $HOME/az104-06-vm-parameters.json `
      -nameSuffix 3 `
      -AsJob
   ```
    >**Note**: Wait for the deployments to complete before proceeding to the next task. This should take about 5 minutes.

    >**Note**: To verify the status of the deployments, you can examine the properties of the resource groups you created in this task.

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane.

#### Task 2: Configure the hub and spoke network topology

In this task, you will configure local peering between the virtual networks you deployed in the previous tasks in order to create a hub and spoke network topology.

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Virtual networks**.

1. Review the virtual networks you created in the previous task. 

    >**Note**: The template you used for deployment of the three virtual networks ensures that the IP address ranges of the three virtual networks do not overlap.

1. In the list of virtual networks, click **az104-06-vnet01**.

1. On the **az104-06-vnet01** virtual network blade, in the **Settings** section, click **Peerings** and then click **+ Add**.

1. Add a peering with the following settings (leave others with their default values):

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | This virtual network: Peering link name | **az104-06-vnet01_to_az104-06-vnet2** |
    | Trafffic to remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network | **Block traffic that originates from outside this virtual network** |
    | Virtual network gateway | **None (default)** |
    | Remote virtual network: Peering link name | **az104-06-vnet2_to_az104-06-vnet01** |
    | Virtual network deployment model | **Resource manager** |
    | Subscription | the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab |
    | Virtual network | **az104-06-vnet2** |   
    | Trafffic to remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | Virtual network gateway | **None (default)** |
    
    >**Note**: Wait for the operation to complete.

    >**Note**: This step establishes two local peerings - one from az104-06-vnet01 to az104-06-vnet2 and the other from az104-06-vnet2 to az104-06-vnet01.

    >**Note**: **Allow forwarded traffic** needs to be enabled in order to facilitate routing between spoke virtual networks, which you will implement later in this lab.

1. On the **az104-06-vnet01** virtual network blade, in the **Settings** section, click **Peerings** and then click **+ Add**.

1. Add a peering with the following settings (leave others with their default values):

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | This virtual network: Peering link name | **az104-06-vnet01_to_az104-06-vnet3** |
    | Trafffic to remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network | **Block traffic that originates from outside this virtual network** |
    | Virtual network gateway | **None (default)** |
    | Remote virtual network: Peering link name | **az104-06-vnet3_to_az104-06-vnet01** |
    | Virtual network deployment model | **Resource manager** |
    | Subscription | the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab |
    | Virtual network | **az104-06-vnet3** |
    | Trafffic to remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | Virtual network gateway | **None (default)** |

    >**Note**: This step establishes two local peerings - one from az104-06-vnet01 to az104-06-vnet3 and the other from az104-06-vnet3 to az104-06-vnet01. This completes setting up the hub and spoke topology (with two spoke virtual networks).

    >**Note**: **Allow forwarded traffic** needs to be enabled in order to facilitate routing between spoke virtual networks, which you will implement later in this lab.

#### Task 3: Test transitivity of virtual network peering

In this task, you will test transitivity of virtual network peering by using Network Watcher.

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Network Watcher**.

1. On the **Network Watcher** blade, expand the listing of Azure regions and verify that the service is enabled in the Azure into which you deployed resources in the first task of this lab.

1. On the **Network Watcher** blade, navigate to the **Connection troubleshoot**.

1. On the **Network Watcher - Connection troubleshoot** blade, initiate a check with the following settings (leave others with their default values):

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab |
    | Resource group | **az104-06-rg1** |
    | Source type | **Virtual machine** |
    | Virtual machine | **az104-06-vm0** |
    | Destination | **Specify manually** |
    | URI, FQDN or IPv4 | **10.62.0.4** |
    | Protocol | **TCP** |
    | Destination Port | **3389** |

    > **Note**: **10.62.0.4** represents the private IP address of **az104-06-vm2**

1. Click **Check** and wait until results of the connectivity check are returned. Verify that the status is **Reachable**. Review the network path and note that the connection was direct, with no intermediate hops in between the VMs.

    > **Note**: This is expected, since the hub virtual network is peered directly with the first spoke virtual network.

    > **Note**: The initial check can take about 2 minutes because it requires installation of the Network Watcher Agent virtual machine extension on **az104-06-vm0**.

1. On the **Network Watcher - Connection troubleshoot** blade, initiate a check with the following settings (leave others with their default values):

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab |
    | Resource group | **az104-06-rg1** |
    | Source type | **Virtual machine** |
    | Virtual machine | **az104-06-vm0** |
    | Destination | **Specify manually** |
    | URI, FQDN or IPv4 | **10.63.0.4** |
    | Protocol | **TCP** |
    | Destination Port | **3389** |

    > **Note**: **10.63.0.4** represents the private IP address of **az104-06-vm3**

1. Click **Check** and wait until results of the connectivity check are returned. Verify that the status is **Reachable**. Review the network path and note that the connection was direct, with no intermediate hops in between the VMs.

    > **Note**: This is expected, since the hub virtual network is peered directly with the second spoke virtual network.

1. On the **Network Watcher - Connection troubleshoot** blade, initiate a check with the following settings (leave others with their default values):

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab |
    | Resource group | **az104-06-rg2** |
    | Source type | **Virtual machine** |
    | Virtual machine | **az104-06-vm2** |
    | Destination | **Specify manually** |
    | URI, FQDN or IPv4 | **10.63.0.4** |
    | Protocol | **TCP** |
    | Destination Port | **3389** |

1. Click **Check** and wait until results of the connectivity check are returned. Note that the status is **Unreachable**. 

    > **Note**: This is expected, since the two spoke virtual networks are not peered with each other (virtual network peering is not transitive).

#### Task 4: Configure routing in the hub and spoke topology

In this task, you will configure and test routing between the two spoke virtual networks by enabling IP forwarding on the network interface of the **az104-06-vm0** virtual machine, enabling routing within its operating system, and configuring user-defined routes on the spoke virtual network.

    | Connection draining | **Disable** |
    | Request time-out (seconds) | **20** |

1. Click **Add** on the **Add an HTTP setting** blade, and back on the **Add a routing rule** blade, click **Add**.

1. Click **Next: Tags >**, followed by **Next: Review + create >** and then click **Create**.

    > **Note**: Wait for the Application Gateway instance to be created. This might take about 8 minutes.

1. In the Azure portal, search and select **Application Gateways** and, on the **Application Gateways** blade, click **az104-06-appgw5**.

1. On the **az104-06-appgw5** Application Gateway blade, note the value of the **Frontend public IP address**.

1. Start another browser window and navigate to the IP address you identified in the previous step.

1. Verify that the browser window displays the message **Hello World from az104-06-vm2** or **Hello World from az104-06-vm3**.

1. Open another browser window but this time by using InPrivate mode and verify whether the target vm changes (based on the message displayed on the web page). 

    > **Note**: You might need to refresh the browser window or open it again by using InPrivate mode.

    > **Note**: Targeting virtual machines on multiple virtual networks is not a common configuration, but it is meant to illustrate the point that Application Gateway is capable of targeting virtual machines on multiple virtual networks (as well as endpoints in other Azure regions or even outside of Azure), unlike Azure Load Balancer, which load balances across virtual machines in the same virtual network.

#### Clean up resources

   >**Note**: Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not see unexpected charges.

1. In the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.

1. List all resource groups created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

   ```pwsh
   Get-AzResourceGroup -Name 'az104-06*'
   ```

1. Delete all resource groups you created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

   ```pwsh
   Get-AzResourceGroup -Name 'az104-06*' | Remove-AzResourceGroup -Force -AsJob
   ```

    >**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the -AsJob parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately afterwards within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.

#### Review

In this lab, you have:

- Provisioned the lab environment
- Configured the hub and spoke network topology
- Tested transitivity of virtual network peering
+ Task 4: Configure routing in the hub and spoke topology
+ Task 5: Implement Azure Load Balancer
+ Task 6: Implement Azure Application Gateway
